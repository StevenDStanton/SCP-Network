My Kids love SCPs so I built this browser based console application to let my kids interact with a foundation AI.

Currently you can ask it anything you want and it will respond.

I have it set up to run on S3, and Lambdas. It can be deployed with the deploy.ps1 script on Windows using PowerShell.

You will need to set up some other stuff like cloudfront, route53 and AWS secrets. I may write a full tutorial on the setup in the future.
