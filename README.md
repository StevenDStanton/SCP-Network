# SCP Foundation AI Console

My kids have always been fascinated by SCPs, so I created this browser-based console application to let them interact with a Foundation AI.

## Features

- Engage in conversations: Ask the AI any question related to SCPs, and it will provide a response.
  
## Deployment

- The application is currently set up to run on AWS services: **S3** and **Lambda**.
- Deployment is made easy using the `deploy.ps1` script on Windows with **PowerShell**.
  
## Prerequisites

Before deploying, make sure to set up the necessary AWS services:

- CloudFront
- Route53
- AWS Secrets
  
_I'm considering writing a detailed tutorial on the complete setup in the near future._

## Live Demo
